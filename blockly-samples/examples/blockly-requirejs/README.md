# blockly-requirejs-sample [![Built on Blockly](https://tinyurl.com/built-on-blockly)](https://github.com/google/blockly)

This sample shows how to load Blockly with [RequireJS](https://requirejs.org/) using ``AMD``.

Note: This sample actually references the Blockly ``UMD`` package built and published to ``npm``, but since it's UMD (Universal), we're able to load that package in an ``AMD`` environment.

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Running

```
npm run start
```

## Browse

Open [http://localhost:3000/index.html](http://localhost:3000/index.html)
